# BombBomb HTML5 Video Heatmap Assignment
Please create, and host online, a web page that loads a fun random video every time it’s visited. When the visitor plays the video, please display on the page a live visualization of the viewer’s interactions with the video in a way that delights or intrigues.

Use any technologies you like to accomplish this. Reviewers will take an interest in both how the experience is presented, and how the reporting is accomplished. There is no need to implement a server-side component, but you’re welcome to.

Good luck, and have fun!
